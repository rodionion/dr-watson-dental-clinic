<h1>
	Teeth Whitening
</h1>

<div id="animation-container"></div>

<p>
	Teeth whitening, as the name suggests, is a process of bleaching teeth to make the existing colour lighter (or whiter) by several shades.
</p>

<h2>
	Why people choose whitening?
</h2>

<p>
	Have you ever noticed that when children grow their first set of permanent teeth, they look very white in colour, like on our advertising pictures? Well, as we grow, almost everyone will develop off-white discoloration or even staining of our teeth, usually caused by food and drink. And many people choose teeth whitening as they would like to bring back the ‘glory days’ of their teeth, and once again smile without holding anything back.
</p>

<h2>
	What causes tooth discoloration?
</h2>

<p>
	What do we mean by teeth discoloration? When teeth don’t look naturally white anymore, the discoloration maybe from slight off-white colour to yellow to brown and even grey. Most people have some sort of teeth discoloration either because of natural colour or due things that enter our mouths like food, drink, and tobacco. These things have intense colour pigments known as chromogens, that leave a trail map on our teeth enamel that over many years can lead to stains that are very hard to remove just by brushing. Some examples of things that are known to cause these discolorations are: 
	Food:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Berries (e.g. pomegranates and grapes);</li>
	<li>Beets (e.g. beetroot);</li>
	<li>Chocolate (e.g. dark coloured chocolate and candy);</li>
	<li>Nuts (e.g. walnuts);</li>
	<li>Popsicles and Slushies;</li>
	<li>Sauces (e.g. soy and curry sauce) </li>
	<li>Sweets (especially the ones that are brightly coloured)</li>
	<li>Tomato Sauce and Ketchup </li>
</ul>

<p>
	Drink
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Black Coffee</li>
	<li>Coca Cola</li>
	<li>Tea (especially black teas like English Breakfast and Earl Grey, better to go for green and herbal teas)</li>
	<li>Wine (red wine is a famous criminal in teeth staining affair)</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Tobacco Use
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Tar is naturally dark in colour</li>
	<li>Nicotine causes yellowish staining</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Age<br><br>
	Tooth enamel is the outer, hard, and white shell of our teeth. Immediately underneath it is a layer called dentin. Dentin is darker, yellowish in colour. So say we eat 3 times a day every day for 30 years, which means that we have had 32,850 meals! As we have discussed before some foods and drinks can be acidic and eat away our tooth enamel, slowly making it thinner and revealing more and more the yellowish layer underneath, dentin.<br><br>
	Trauma<br><br>
	If there was a physical damage to the mouth e.g. from a bad fall, the teeth may change colour to more yellow shade because our bodies reaction to tooth injury is to put more layers of dentin, which is a darker layer under the enamel.
</p>

<h2>
	How Does Teeth Whitening Work?
</h2>

<p>
	Teeth whitening goes back in history to 1884, when a chemical called hydrogen peroxide was first used as a whitening agent. In 1960’ another chemical, called carbamide peroxide was introduced and showed better whitening results. These chemicals have a similar effect, they bleach (i.e. break) the stains on teeth into smaller parts, which disperses the concentrated stains and makes teeth colour brighter.<br><br>
	At our dentistry we use carbamide gel together with a specialised machine. Before the procedure, we always check if the teeth and gums of the patient are healthy and ready for the procedure.<br><br>
	After careful protection of gums and lips, the carbamide gel is applied to the teeth surface with simultaneous application of a high intensity light in a specific spectrum to intensify the whitening effect. Achieving about several shades of whitening after only a single session lasting 60 to 90-minute long. The whitening procedure is recommended to individuals of 20 years and older2. 
</p>

<h2>
	Does Whitening Work on All Teeth?
</h2>

<p>
	No, whitening might not be the best option for a number of reason to certain people. And that’s why it’s very important that we first examine your teeth and gums before deciding to whiten your teeth, to give the best treatment tailored for you. For example, if tooth discoloration is caused by a tooth injury or strong medications, as well as whitening of crowns, fillings, and veneers will not work. Also, while yellow and off-white coloured teeth often bleach well, brown coloured teeth and teeth with grey tones may not whiten as well.
