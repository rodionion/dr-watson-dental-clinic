<h1>
	Do You Really Need Flossing?
</h1>

<div id="animation-container"></div>

<p>
	One of the most popular oral hygiene commandments that we have always been asked to follow is<br><br>
	<em>Floss once daily to keep dental decay at bay.</em><br><br>
	Ever wondered what flossing (apart from the popular dance move) means exactly?<br><br>
	We have been told that it helps us maintain our oral health. Is that really so, or is there something more to it? Let us try to find out why, exactly, flossing needs to become a part of our daily routine.
</p>


<h2>
	What is flossing?
</h2>

<p>
	Dental flossing is the process by which a thread-like material, called floss, is passed in between two teeth. This keeps the interdental area (the area between teeth) clean leading to healthy teeth and a bright smile.
</p>

<h2>
		Why is flossing considered good?
</h2>

<p>
	To understand the benefits of flossing, we should understand that a tooth has five surfaces- front and back, left and right, and top (the bottom one is concealed within the gums and jawbone).<br><br>
	When we use a toothbrush to clean our teeth, we clean only three surfaces- front, top and, maybe 30% to 50% of the backside of teeth. In that case, who takes care of the right and left? Actually, no one! The bristles of our toothbrush never enter that zone.<br><br>
	What next? Those surfaces turn into a storehouse of plaque and food debris, as there is nothing that can wash them off. Plaque is a soft, slimy layer that is composed of bacteria. A part of plaque hardens to form tartar. These hard deposits cannot be removed by brushing. This is when we need professional help with dental services. Only through professional dental cleaning tartar can be removed.<br><br>
	Bacteria within the plaque cause the surrounding gums to inflame, leading to gingivitis. The symptoms of gingivitis are red and swollen gums, and gums begin to bleed easily even when they get slightly poked (like by the bristles of our toothbrush). Inflamed gums, when left unattended, become weak and can also lead to wobbly teeth.<br><br>
	The unchecked bacterial action in the area between the teeth can put us at a high risk of developing cavities. When the bacteria from plaque feed on food debris, they release acid in return. This acid starts dissolving the outer layer of the teeth, thereby initiating the process of cavity formation.<br><br>
	Food pieces stuck in between the teeth can cause bad breath and can put someone in an embarrassing situation if the front teeth are involved.<br><br>
	Flossing can save us from this entire sequela of misery. What? A single piece of thread?<br><br>
	Yes. This is true! Flossing cleans what our toothbrush fails to. It improves our oral health as it can remove plaque, prevent tartar formation, dental cavities, and gingivitis, reduce the risk of losing supporting bone, and avoid bad breath. Thatâ€™s way too many benefits a single piece of thread can bring in our lives!
</p>

<h2>
	How should we do flossing?
</h2>

<p>
	Now that we know the importance of flossing for our dental care, the next step would be to learn the technique of flossing. With the help of these five easy steps, we can become masters in the art of flossing.<br><br>
	<ol>
		<li>Take out the floss of about 40 cm and roll it around the middle finger of one hand. This hand should be the source of fresh unused floss. Leave only 10 cm for the middle finger of the other hand. This hand should be the one where you wind the dirty used floss.</li>
		<li>Make the floss taut using your thumbs and fingers.</li>
		<li>Carefully insert the floss in the area between the teeth.</li>
		<li>When the floss is close to the gums, wrap the floss around the teeth in a C shape. Now move it gently into the space between the tooth and gums.</li>
		<li>Next would be the cleaning of the teeth surface. For that move the floss in gentle up and down motion with the floss held tightly against the tooth.</li>
		<li>Repeat the above mentioned five steps for all the teeth, including the back surface of the rearmost teeth. Keep winding the used floss so that you have unused floss ready for the next tooth. You can start from the left upper side and continue in a clockwise direction. Following a particular sequence ensures that you never miss a single tooth.</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<h2>
	When should we do flossing?
</h2>

<p>
	We can floss before brushing our teeth or even after brushing as there is no scientific evidence suggesting which one would be better. What matters the most is that the teeth are flossed at least once a day. Once we are through with flossing, we should remember to rinse our mouth thoroughly with water.
</p>

<h2>
	What should we be careful about during flossing?
</h2>

<p>
	Unlike brushing teeth, flossing for your oral care takes some genuine time. This is only during those initial days of learning the skill. Meanwhile, we should be careful about a few things while flossing.
	<ul>
		<li>We should not snap the floss in between the gums while inserting it. This can do more harm than good as repeated snapping can cause the gums to wear off from the area in between the teeth.</li>
		<li>We should refrain from using the used/dirty floss. Sliding the same floss into a new section of mouth will never resolve the issue instead, introduce bacteria from one part to another part. So, we must keep winding the used floss as we move from one surface to another. Similarly, washing floss and keeping it for reuse is not advisable as our washing techniques may not be sufficient to cleanse the floss from loads of bacteria from the previous use.</li>
		<li>We should never use any other product other than the dental floss in between our teeth. When food particles get stuck in between the teeth, we may grab things like our finger, toothpick, or thread to remove it. These things are not recommended for use as they can hurt the gums.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>
	How to choose floss and where to buy?
</h2>

<p>
	Choosing the right floss for ourselves can be tricky. It depends on the type of teeth we have and the type of situation we need the floss for. Here are guidelines that will help in choosing the right kind of dental floss.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Waxed or unwaxed. If our teeth have tight spaces, waxed floss is the best as it can glide through those tight spaces easily. Waxed floss is also a good choice for those who wear braces. One advantage of using unwaxed floss is that it makes a squeaky sound when rubbed on a clean tooth surface.</li>
	<li>Thick or thin. For widely apart teeth, thick floss is recommended as thin floss would be, practically, of no use. Teeth with regular spacing can be cleaned with regular thin floss.</li>
	<li>Flavored or without flavor. Opting for flavor is purely based on our preference, as there is no additional benefit of using a flavored one over an unflavored one.</li>
	<li>Multifilament or single-filament. Multifilament floss is composed of nylon mostly. It is commonly available and is less expensive. The downside of using a multi-filament floss is that it can split or shred while passing through areas that are a little rough like the edges of the unpolished fillings.</li>
	<li>Single-filament floss is made of rubber or plastic and does not wear off as easily as the multifilament ones.</li>
	<li>Floss picks. We can always purchase flossing aids if we feel that we are not skilful enough to perform the conventional method of flossing. Floss picks (a piece of floss held by two arms with a handle) are quite helpful while flossing the back teeth as the handle can be extended towards the rearmost tooth.</li>
	<li>Electric flossers. They look pretty much like a floss pick, but it is quite easy to use as the floss vibrates to clean the tooth surfaces.</li>
	<li>Water flossers. This product helps in cleaning the interdental area with the help of a blast of water. Water flossers make flossing mess-free and convenient. It is a boon to those who wear braces as conventional flossing technique is extremely cumbersome with braces on.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The products mentioned above are available in different brands and can be easily purchased online or from stores in the city. Whenever in doubt, you should seek the advice of your dentist before picking any oral hygiene product for ourselves. Your dentist can guide you better as they know our dental needs exactly. Another method of being sure about the quality of the products you buy is by checking the ADA seal. All the products that have been tried, tested, and accepted by the American Dental Association will have their seal. This is the right way of making smart choices.	
</p>

<h2>
	Final Words
</h2>

<p>
	After going through all the information regarding flossing, we can definitely say that we do need flossing. It is an exercise that involves skill, and that cannot be developed overnight. You must have heard a famous quote from Will Durant:<br><br>
	<em>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.</em><br><br>
	Simply put, floss daily to be better and quicker at it. It can never be considered as an alternative to brushing teeth but should always be used as an adjunct to oral hygiene maintenance. Why not develop a good habit when it is worth all your effort and time!<br><br>
	Happy Flossing!
