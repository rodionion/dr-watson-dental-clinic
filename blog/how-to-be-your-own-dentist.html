<h1>Be Your Own Dentist</h1>

<div id="animation-container"></div>

<p id="text-near-animation">
	Yes, you need to brush your teeth every day. No, this is not enough. Just by brushing your teeth, you can’t prevent oral problems like bad breath, gingivitis, cavities and others. Yet if you care for your teeth properly, you will have much less occasions to visit your dentist. This will save you a lot of money, time and comfort.<br><br>
</p>


<p>
	Like any other organ, teeth are an essential part of our body. To own a healthy and bright smile, you need to follow some simple oral hygiene tips. This will give you solid oral health and reduce the times you need to visit a dentist. Since you’ll have little to no dental problems for a dentist to solve.<br><br>
	However, you will still have to see your dentist once or twice per year for a check-up, even if your teeth are bright and shiny. This is an important preventative measure. It’s far easier and cheaper to cure a problem in its early stage rather than when it’s progressed and developed.<br><br>
	<em>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</em>
</p>


<h2>
	Why Is Oral Health Important?
</h2>

<p>
	By taking good care of your oral and dental health, you can avoid bad breath, tooth decay, and gum diseases. Also, isn’t it amazing to grow old with healthy and strong teeth? <br><br>Your oral health has a definite connection with your overall health. A healthy mouth also guards you against some systemic disorders like cardiac problems, stroke, uncontrolled diabetes, pregnancy complications, etc.<br><br>
	So let’s discuss some ways to take care of your oral health to avoid frequent dental visits.
</p>

<h2>
	Brush Your Teeth Properly
</h2>

<p>
	We all follow a routine of brushing, bathing, and getting dressed every day. For better dental health, take a little extra time during brushing and follow these tips.<br><br>
	Brushing Tips
	<ul>
		<li>Always use a normal size, medium or hard bristle toothbrush.</li>
		<li>Start brushing from your gumline, with a gentle stroke, move your brush on your gums back and forth. Then proceed to your tooth surface.</li>
		<li>Make sure to clean all surfaces of your teeth.</li>
		<li>While brushing your front teeth, move your bristles vertically to remove all the plaque.</li>
		<li>Reach back and brush all the sides of your molars.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Some crucial facts about brushing
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Brush your teeth twice a day. Do not rush while you brush. Take out two minutes to brush your teeth nicely. Try not to brush immediately after eating. If you have consumed any acidic food like oranges or grapefruit, brushing on acid-coated teeth might soften your enamel. Brushing after thirty minutes of your meal is ideal. Cleaning your tongue every time after brushing is also essential.</li>
		<li>Choose the right products for brushing. Use a small strip of fluoride toothpaste (yes, a small strip is enough, trust us) and a soft-bristled toothbrush. You can also use electric toothbrushes, which makes brushing more comfortable and effectively removes plaque. Whether you opt for manual brushing or an electric brush, use proper technique and brush long enough.</li>
		<li>Keep your toothbrush clean. Wash your toothbrush well after brushing and store it in an upright position. It should dry in the open air before the next use. Keep your brush separate from other brushes in the holder to avoid any cross-contamination.</li>
		<li>Change your toothbrush regularly. Changing your toothbrush every 3-5 months is essential. If you are using an electric brush, replace its head. If you don’t change your toothbrush, its bristles become frayed, and brushing becomes less effective.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>

<h2>
	Flossing Is Important Too
</h2>

<p>
	Can your toothbrush reach the tight spaces between your teeth? No, it can’t. That’s where flossing comes in. <br><br>
	It removes plaque and food deposits from such areas. By preventing plaque buildup, it makes your teeth look brighter and feel healthier. We advise flossing at least once daily.<br><br>

	Why that is and more information on flossing is here.<br><br>

	Tips for effective flossing
	<ul>
		<li>Take about 45 cm of floss, wind most of it around your middle finger. Wind the remaining floss on the middle finger of your opposite hand. Hold the floss tightly between your forefinger and thumb.</li>
		<li>Gently move your floss between your teeth using a rubbing motion. Once your floss reaches the gum line, curve it against the tooth surface.</li>
		<li>Repeat this process for each tooth, unwinding the fresh floss every time.</li>
		<li>If you find it challenging to handle the floss, use an interdental brush or electric flosser.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>
	Follow a Healthy Diet
</h2>

<p>
	Eating nutrient-rich food is vital for healthy teeth and gums. A balanced diet containing fresh fruits and vegetables, calcium-rich food, vitamin C, and whole grains is good for better oral health. Not to mention your overall health. Have your three natural healthy meals a day. If you like to snack, choose natural snacks such as nuts and fruits.<br><br>

	At all costs avoid overly sweetened processed products like candies, sugared beverages, packed juices, sodas. If your teeth could scream, you would hear them very loudly every time your opened that can of the sparkling soft drink.<br><br>
	
	Rinse your mouth after every meal to remove any food particles. It’s so easy yet can do wonders for you.<br><br>
	
	Sometimes more than what you eat, the frequency of your eating also affects your dental health. Give your teeth enough time to recover from the attack of acids of your food.
</p>

<h2>
	Drink More Water
</h2>

<p>
	Can drinking simple water help your teeth? Oh yes, it can!<br><br>

	Your saliva is your defence system against tooth decay. Minerals like calcium and phosphate present in saliva help to fight tooth decay. Drinking more water helps your body produce more saliva, which prevents dry mouth and keeps tooth decay at bay. Also, drinking adequate water after every meal helps to wash away sticky and acidic food.
</p>

<h2>
	Limit Soft Drinks And Alcohol
</h2>

<p>
	These soft drinks are loaded with sugar and acids that harm your teeth at an astonishing rate. Alcohol consumption leads to drying of your mouth, which results in inflammation of oral tissues, dental erosion, and caries.
</p>

<h2>
	Quit Smoking
</h2>

<p>
	Yes, you know it and heard it before, but this post would never be complete without mentioning smoking.<br><br>

	Smoking is so harmful for your oral health (as well as overall health) that it’s astonishing people would do that voluntarily. Yet people do.<br><br>
	
	Tobacco smoking leads to gum diseases and periodontal complications. Smoking impairs the blood flow to your gums, which delays healing. And yes, smoking brings cancer in the mouth, throat, cheeks, gums and lips.<br><br>
	
	Please don’t smoke.
</p>

<h2>
	Use Mouthwash
</h2>

<p>
	Finally, swishing your mouth with mouthwash can give a perfect finishing touch to your deep cleaning routine. Mouthwash removes the remaining adherent bacteria and gives you a fresh breath. Use the right amount of mouthwash as indicated on the label and swish it forcefully between your teeth. Continue for 60 seconds and then spit it out. Using a fluoride-containing mouthwash gives additional protection to your teeth.
</p>

<h2>
	When to Visit a Dentist
</h2>

<p>
	There are times when you have to visit your dentist. For some severe dental problems, you might need dental services right away. Some such pointers that indicate your dental visit is due:
	
	<ul>
	<li>Sharp shooting pain in your tooth. If you experience sudden sharp pain while chewing food, it indicates that your tooth decay is in progress. Visit your dentist to get your teeth checked.</li>
	<li>Pain in gums or bleeding while brushing. Inflamed gums result in gingivitis or periodontitis. Imagine if your nails bled, would you care? The same is true for your gums. If you see even a little blood while brushing, consult your dentist.</li>
	<li>White spots on your teeth. If you notice any white spots on your teeth, that means tooth decay has begun. Visit your dentist before it spreads any further.</li>
	<li>If teeth are sensitive to hot and cold. During gum diseases, crack in your tooth, tooth grinding, or caries, you experience such sensitivity. Your dentist can help you to find the reason behind such pain and the right treatment.</li>
	<li>If you develop sores in your oral cavity. Sores on your gums, or cheeks that do not go away after three days, need medical attention.</li>
	<li>If you have dry mouth. Some medications or underlying health condition results in dry mouth. It can also be the result of an infection. Consult your dentist to find the right cause and solution for it.</li>
	<li>Bad breath. Consistent bad breath even after proper teeth cleaning can be due to gum disease, dental cavity, or some medical condition. Discuss with your dentist to rule out any serious condition.</li>
	<li>Jaw pain. Dental problems like teeth grinding can be the reason for your jaw pain. Make an appointment to get your oral cavity checked.</li>
	<li>Swollen gums or loose teeth. In this condition visit your dentist right away.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	Pay a visit to your dentist when you have pain, the sooner the better to avoid complications.<br><br>
	
	There is a better rule:<br><br>
	
	<em>Pay a visit to your dentist before you have pain.</em><br><br>
	
	By that we mean regular dental check-ups, of course.<br><br>
	
	Have you ever wondered why we advise regular dental check-ups?<br><br>
	
	Most dental problems on early stages don’t have any symptoms that you would pick up. They don’t pain or itch or smell. You may have no idea that they are there.<br><br>
	
	But a dentist can see them and remove them fast and cheap. However, if you let the problem to develop to a stage when it pains, then it’ll be more painful and expensive to tackle on this later stage.<br><br>
	
	During the dental visit, your dentist not only checks for any dental caries or gum diseases, but he also evaluates your oral health for, any signs of systemic diseases, your TMJ movement, your bite, and complete oral health.<br><br>
	
	If there are any signs of plaque deposits or bad breath, you will be recommended to a dental hygienist to get your teeth professionally cleaned. For all these reasons it is essential to visit your dentist regularly.<br><br>
	
	Skipping your routine dental check-up may not sound like a big issue, but minor oral problems can progress into severe conditions before you even notice it. To maintain good oral health, meet your dentist regularly. We advise our patients a dental check-up every 6 months.
	</p>
</p>

<h2>
	Bottom Line
</h2>

<p>
	Following these simple steps can definitely help you to avoid most dental problems and drastically reduce the visits to your dentist. Just think of how much money, time and effort you can save by helping your own mouth.<br><br>

	Advantages: many.<br><br>
	
	Disadvantages: none.<br><br>
	
	Why not do that?<br><br>
	
	But remember, even after following all these dental hygiene routines, you need to visit your dentist once or twice a year. A dentist not only cleans your teeth and fills the cavities, but he can also spot potential issues before they have progressed.
