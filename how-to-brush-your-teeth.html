<h1>
	How To Brush Your Teeth Properly
</h1>

<div id="animation-container"></div>

<p>
	Brushing your teeth incorrectly is like eating soup with a fork. Very little gets done and the soup is not enjoyed.<br><br>
	Here we will discover why it’s important to brush your teeth properly, how to do that, and what happens if you don’t.<br><br>
	Let’s go!
</p>

<h2>
	Why healthy teeth are so important?
</h2>

<p>
	What do you think is the hardest substance in the human body? If you said Tooth Enamel, you guessed right! Tooth Enamel is the hardest tissue, the highest most mineralized substance that we all have. And it gives a hard time to all 800 types of bacteria in our mouths.<br><br>
	What else does it do? Helps us chew whatever food we like, gives shape to our face, helps us talk clearly, sing, and of course, makes a healthy and beautiful smile.<br><br>
	In this post, we will see how to take care of your teeth, so that they help take care of you (and of course, make you proud of your smile).
</p>

<h2>
	Why should we brush our teeth?
</h2>

<p>
	Brushing our teeth properly and regularly matters for three reasons:
<p>

<ol>
	<li>Plaque</li>
	<li>Tartar</li>
	<li>Gum disease</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Let us look at each of these closer.
</p>

<h2>
	1. Plaque
</h2>

<p>
	Plaque (say: PLAK), is a clear layer of bacteria that forms on our teeth 4-12 hours after brushing, which is why it is recommended to brush twice a day and floss daily.
</p>

<p>
	What causes plaque?
	After we eat food, small pieces of sugars or starch stick to our teeth. Now this becomes food for bacteria that forms a thin layer, aka plaque, on the surface of the teeth. Bacteria also uses these sugars to produce acid. This acid also sticks to the plaque around our teeth and ends up damaging tooth enamel, leading to tooth decay. If this plaque is not brushed away it will slowly start to form cavities (aka holes) and can cause gum disease.<br><br>
	How to prevent and treat plaque?<br><br>
	Here it comes – brushing thoroughly twice a day with fluoride-containing toothpaste and flossing at least once a day to remove pieces of food stuck between the teeth. When brushing pay attention to especially the place where the gums and teeth meet. Also, antibacterial mouth rinse is a good addition to the routine as it decreases the number of bacteria that can cause plaque and gum disease.<br><br>
	And let us not forget the main part that started all this conversation – the food that we eat. It is just as important to have a balanced diet and limit the number of sugary snacks. Why are vegetables important part of a balanced diet for our teeth? Vegetables help to balance out the acids that bacteria produce in plaque thus making it less harmful for the teeth.<br><br>
	Finally, after all these important routines that you’ve been doing, every 6 months visit your dentist for a checkup and for a deep teeth cleaning (aka scaling and polishing).
</p>

<h2>
	2. Tartar
</h2>

<p>
	Plaque that is not brushed away in time can become hard and turn into tartar, making it more harmful for the teeth and more difficult to remove. Tartar can also buildup on our gums causing gum disease.<br><br>
	What causes tartar?<br><br>
	It starts with ‘p’ and ends with ‘e’ – you guessed right – plaque!<br><br>
	How to prevent and treat tartar?<br><br>
	The best way to prevent it is to brush and floss away plaque in time, however, it is very common to have some tartar left unnoticed especially on the inside of the back teeth but not to worry, by visiting your dentist it can be removed! Particularly, the tartar will be scraped with special instruments above and below the gumline and the surface of the teeth will be smoothened. The smoother the surface the harder it is for tartar formation.
</p>

<h2>
	3. Gum disease
</h2>

<p>
	Tooth enamel is not the only thing we all share, in fact about 50 % of all people on Earth had, have, or will have gum disease. Gum disease is where the gums become swollen, sore, may bleed when brushing our teeth, cause bad breath or become infected. The mild form is called gingivitis (say: jin-juh-vy-tis). In that case, only our gums have bacterial infection. If that is not treated, the infection can go under the gum and into the bone. This is a more serious form called periodontitis. It is more serious because it affects the jawbone that holds our teeth in place. If periodontitis is not treated, the teeth can become loose and even fall out.<br><br>
	Both forms have been shown to increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, pneumonia, and cancer. Early detection and treatment are the best choices; therefore, it is important to have regular check-ups (every 6 months to a year) and let your dentist take care of you.
</p>

<p>
	What causes gum disease?<br><br>
	Have you already guessed what causes gum disease? Yes, the sinner is build-up of plaque on the teeth. Plaque is sticky layer of bacteria.<br><br>
	If the plaque is not brushed off from the teeth, it builds up and irritates our gums. That irritation is gum disease, it can be mild irritation at early stages, i.e. gingivitis, or severe if not treated, i.e. periodontitis.<br><br>
	How to prevent and treat gum disease?<br><br>
	Mild types of gum disease can be treated at home! Simply by flossing and brushing your teeth properly and regularly, as well as having regular dental check-ups. Why are regular dental check-ups important? Because your dentist will be able to identify gum disease early, properly clean your teeth, including around the gumline, removing any plaque and tartar, give advice on a better way to clean your teeth, and advice on the personally best next appointment time for you (based on your teeth and gum status).

<h2>
	How and when to brush your teeth?
</h2>

<p>
	The best love that we can give to our teeth and gums is to brush them twice a day and floss them at least once a day. Brushing not only removes plaque from the teeth but also stimulates the gums, which helps to keep them healthy and prevent gum disease.<br><br>
	Little known fact is knowing WHEN to brush teeth is just as important as to know HOW to do it right. Let us see why this is true.
</p>

<h2>
	Why ‘when’ is important?
</h2>

<p>
	We have discovered before that bacteria in plaque produces acids that eat away our teeth. So what do you think happens when we eat acidic foods and drinks such as grains, sugar, and soda? That’s right, they weaken our tooth enamel even more and brushing too soon can actually, remove some of that weakened enamel! Therefore, it is important to remember to wait for 1 hour after food before brushing your teeth. Patience is a virtue. For example, a good practice is to brush before breakfast in the morning and at least 1 hour after the dinner in the evening.
</p>

<h2>
	How to brush teeth properly?
</h2>

<p>
	The whole process should take about 2 minutes.  First, let us mentally divide our mouths in 4 parts:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Top left</li>
	<li>Top right</li>
	<li>Bottom left</li>
	<li>Bottom right</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The best strategy is to brush from front to back, say first do front and back of top left part of the mouth, then the same of the top right, following by bottom right, and bottom left (the order is up to you).<br><br>
	Then start by brushing the outer surface of each tooth, with the bristle of the toothbrush at 45-degree angle against your gumline. Then with small circular movements move the toothbrush over the entire tooth.<br><br>
	Then repeat with the inner surface of the same tooth.<br><br>
	Then repeat this for the remaining teeth in that area (remember we started with top left part of the mouth).<br><br>
	Final step in that area is to brush with the same circular movement in the chewing area of the teeth.<br><br>
	Time to switch the area of the mouth – here, you decide which part to go to next. Once all the four areas are complete let’s brush the strongest muscle in the human body – the tongue. This is important for a fresh breath!<br><br>
	Finally, it is important to rinse our toothbrush with hot water after every brushing time to remove bacteria, so it doesn’t grow in the toothbrush! We take no prisoners!
