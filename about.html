	<h1>About Dr Watson Dental Clinic</h1>
	<p>We are passionate to heal. That’s our motto and our life.<br><br>
		Most jobs are simple: you give people money, people give you a service in return.<br><br>
		Medicine is different. In Medicine people come to you with real physical pain. And you get to treat it. 
		You heal people and make them feel good again. You help them on a very deep level.
		It’s different. It’s something no money can buy.<br><br>
		That’s why we are passionate to heal. It’s the reason we show up at our Dental Clinic in Leopards Hill Mall 7 days a week.<br>
